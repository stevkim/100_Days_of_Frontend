## About
<span id='about'></span>
<p align='center'>Fun side projects to keep my frontend skills sharp, the challenge was introduced by <a href='https://dev.to/bigsondev/100-free-frontend-challenges-3f0' target="_blank">Adrian @ BigDevSoon</a>.</p>
<p align='center'>You can find the list of challenges <a href='https://app.bigdevsoon.me/challenges' target='_blank'>here</a>.</p>

## Tech Used
<span id='tech'></span>
<p>My approach to this challenge was to use the least amount of external libraries as possible. The exceptions to this were framer-motion for animations, TanStack router for page routing/navigation, and Zod for some mock validation features.</p>
